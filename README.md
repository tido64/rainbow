### Audio

Rainbow integrates [FMOD Studio](https://www.fmod.org/), giving you access to
the same professional tools that AAA studios use. There is also an open source
alternative built on OpenAL. Audio format support depends on the platform.
Typically, MP3 and Ogg Vorbis on Android, and
[AAC, ALAC, and MP3](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/MultimediaPG/UsingAudio/UsingAudio.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009767-CH2-SW33)
on iOS and macOS.

### Graphics

Rainbow is mostly built on
[OpenGL ES 2.0](https://www.khronos.org/opengles/2_X/) and features:

- Sprites-based rendering with explicit batching
- Animation with traditional sprite sheets, or…
- Skeletal animation imported directly from
  [Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com/)
- Text rendering (supports TrueType and OpenType via
  [FreeType](https://freetype.org/))
- Texture atlas
  ([DDS](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb943991(v=vs.85).aspx),
   [PNG](http://libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html),
   [PVRTC](https://community.imgtec.com/developers/powervr/tools/pvrtextool/),
   and [SVG](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/))
- 2d rigid body physics provided by [Box2D](http://box2d.org/)

### Input

- Accelerometer (Android and iOS)
- Keyboard and mouse (Linux/macOS/Windows)
- Microphone (Android and iOS)
- Touch (Android and iOS)

## Building

First of all, clone the repository:

	git clone --recursive https://bitbucket.org/tido/rainbow.git

The repository only includes some of the libraries required to build Rainbow.
The remaining requisites are listed in each platform's section below. They must
be installed or copied into the repository before you can start building
Rainbow.

More details can be found in the
[documentation](https://tido.bitbucket.io/rainbow/#building-rainbow-for-pc).

### On Linux/macOS

Easiest way to build Rainbow is to use the provided build scripts:

	mkdir rainbow-build
	cd rainbow-build
	/path/to/rainbow/tools/build.sh [platform] [options]

Run `build.sh help` to get an overview of options and configurations. `platform`
can be omitted if compiling a native build (i.e. not cross-compiling).

If you have problems running `build.sh`, please make sure it has execution
permission:

	chmod +x /path/to/rainbow/tools/build.sh

### On Windows

Run the PowerShell script `tools\make.ps1` (right-click on it and select
_Run with PowerShell_). It will take you through the steps.

## Getting started

Check out the [documentation here](https://tido.bitbucket.io/rainbow/) or under
`doc`, and the playground under `js`. You can start the playground by running
`rainbow` inside the folder:

	cd /path/to/rainbow/js
	rainbow

Or with the path as argument:

	rainbow /path/to/rainbow/js
